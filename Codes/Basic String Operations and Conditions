MyString1 = "Hello world!"
print(MyString1.index("o"))
# That prints out 4, because the location of the first occurrence of the letter "o" is 4 characters away from the first
# character. Notice how there are actually two o's in the phrase - this method only recognizes the first.
# Indexing in Python starts from 0.

print(MyString1.count("l"))
# Counts the numbers of "insert character here" in your string.

print(MyString1[3:7])
# This prints a slice of the string, starting at index 3, and ending at index 6.

# If you just have one number in the brackets, it will give you the single character at that index. If you leave out the
# first number but keep the colon, it will give you a slice from the start to the number you left in. If you leave out
# the second number, it will give you a slice from the first number to the end.

# You can even put negative numbers inside the brackets. They are an easy way of starting at the end of the string
# instead of the beginning.

print(MyString1[:-1])
# Completely reverses your string.

print(MyString1.upper())
print(MyString1.lower())
# prints your string in upper and lower case respectively

x = 2
print(x == 2)  # equals to
print(x == 3)
print(x < 3)  # less than
print(x != 8)  # not equals to
